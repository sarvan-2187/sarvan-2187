<h2 align="left">👨‍💻 About Me</h2>

<p align="left">
  Ever since I've been young, I had a great interest in technology, and ever since then I've wanted to build a solid foundation in programming. I'm currently pursuing a <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science</strong> at Amrita University.<br>
  
  I’m actively building skills in:
</p>

- Frontend & Backend Development  
- Foundational Machine Learning Concepts  
- Data Structures & Algorithms for Problem Solving

  I’m currently building:
</p>

-  AI Powered SaaS
-  ML Projects  
-  SQL Projects

  My learning extends beyond coursework—I try to work on projects to reinforce concepts that I've learned and occasionally practice DSA problems to enhance my problem-solving abilities. I'm particularly interested in building applications that are both functional and secure.
</p>

  I believe in continuous learning and using technology to solve real-world challenges. Let’s connect and innovate together!
