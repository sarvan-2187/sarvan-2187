<h2 align="left">👨‍💻 About Me</h2>

<p align="left">
  Ever since I've been young, I had a great interest in technology, and ever since then I've wanted to build a solid foundation in programming. I'm currently pursuing a <strong>B.Tech in Computer Science</strong> at Amrita University.<br>
  
  I’m actively building skills in:
</p>

- ⚙️ Frontend & Backend Development  
- 🧠 Foundational Machine Learning Concepts  
- 📈 Data Structures & Algorithms for Problem Solving  

<p align="left">
  My learning extends beyond coursework—I try to work on projects to reinforce concepts that I've learned and occasionally practice DSA problems to enhance my problem-solving abilities. I'm particularly interested in building applications that are both functional and secure. Right now, I'm diving deep into areas like ethical hacking, machine learning, and secure application development to better understand the intersection of AI and Web Development.

  I believe in continuous learning and using technology to solve real-world challenges. Let’s connect and innovate together!
